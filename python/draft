Now i will present dynamique program that we develop to solve Elementary shortest path with single slot.
Here is small visual example of this problem :
we have 5 clients each of them have time slot 
Important property of this problem that we could pre order clients based on time slot opening.
Becouse for example we for shure know that clients 4 and 1 could be visited only before 3 due to time slot constraint, how evere we still could not visit client 4 before client 3 due to end of time slot of client 4.
We say  that tour is feasiable if it doesn't fiolate the time slot constraint , for example tour 1,3 is feasible.
This property alow as to construct recurence relation for Ti , 
where Ti represent minimal cost of the tour that starts at the depot and ends at client i
Ti equals to minimum between cost of going from depot to client i 
and cost of extension of the tour that end at the client j with client i, with the condition that j,i is feasible tour.
Using this recurence relation we develop algorithm witch i will show on the small example 
We have a table that represent value Ti for each client
We start with client 4 becose he have earlyest time slot opening we could see that only tour from depot is feseble , then T4 equals to cost of going from depot to client 4,
We have same situation for the client 1 because tour 4,1 is not feaseble.
for client 3 we could extend tour that ends at the client 1 and get cost lower then cost of going from depot to client 3.
We have inverse situation for client 2 where cost of extending tour that ends at client 1 higher then cost of going from the depot to client 2.
For client 5 we could extend tour that ends at client 4 and 1 and we chose extention that have lower cost.
When we compute all Ti we find cost of extention of each tour with depot, and minimal one will be cost of our solution, 
then we could find tour with simple backtracking.
